At the moment, this program is only being supported on linux. However, if you feel like trying it on another OS, feel free :)

Requires:
Qt4.7 or higher
OpenGL headers

Building glFireworks:
Since I've been using a QT based window system for this project, I figured that I'd fool around with using qmake as my build system. For you, the end-user, this means that you'll need to have qmake installed on your system. To compile from the project file that I include:
Type:
qmake
make

This generates the make file, then uses the make utility to build it. A binary file called FireworksSimulator will be generated for your convenience.

To run:
Execute the FireworksSimulator binary after building it.
